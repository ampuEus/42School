# Push_swap : Because Swap_push isn’t as natural
***Officially finished at 2022-12-xx / Grade: xxx of 100 / Versión en [español](LEEME.md)***

In this project you will learn to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To be successful, you will have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sa (swap a)            | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.<br>Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. |
| sb (swap b)            | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.<br>Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. |
| ss                     | sa and sb at the same time.                                                                         |
| pa (push a)            | Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.<br>Do nothing if b is empty.     |
| pb (push b)            | Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.<br>Do nothing if a is empty.     |
| ra (rotate a)          | Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.<br>The first element becomes the last one.                   |
| rb (rotate b)          | Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.<br>The first element becomes the last one.                   |
| rr                     | ra and rb at the same time.                                                                         |
| rra (reverse rotate a) | Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.<br>The last element becomes the first one.                 |
| rrb (reverse rotate b) | Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.<br>The last element becomes the first one.                 |
| rrr                    | rra and rrb at the same time.                                                                       |

### Example


## Basic concepts to learn in this practice
### Computational **complexity**

n -> f(n)

Where:
	n = Size of the input
	f(n) = worst-case complexity
